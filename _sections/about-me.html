<p>Benjamin Mauzé is an Associate Professor with the MAVRICS team of the Laboratory of <a href="https://www.lgp.enit.fr/en/index.html">LGP’s Systems Department</a>.
     He graduated with a mechatronic engineering diploma from <a href="https://www.ensil-ensci.unilim.fr/">ENSIL-ENSCI</a> and an MSc in Applied Mathematics and Optimization from Limoges Science University in 2017.
     He received his doctoral degree in Robotics and Automatics from the University of Burgundy and Franche-Comté at Besançon in January 2021 inside the Automatic and Micro-Mechatronics System Department at the Femto-ST Institute.
    His research focuses on continuum robotics at several levels design, fabrication, modeling, and control. Continuum structure contributions in parallel and exoskeleton architectures drive his research. 
    He creates innovative structures thanks to shape memory alloys, modeled and controlled by SOFA <a href="https://www.sofa-framework.org/"></a>.
    He teaches Automatics and Robotics at the Engineering National School (<a href="https://www.enit.fr/en/index.html">ENIT</a>.</p>
